AI-Based Plagiarism Detection Tool is a Python-based application that scans and compares multiple .txt documents to identify potential plagiarism between them. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to compute how similar two documents are â€” accurately detecting content overlap.
This project was a deep dive into how AI and machine learning concepts can be applied to real-world academic integrity problems.
